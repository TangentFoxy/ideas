This idea is being worked on in FCOM.

Radial menu opens towards center with options.

Home Base -> Build construction ships, fighters.

Fighters -> Move orders only, auto attack when enemy in range.

Construction ships -> Double tap to build ???

----

For ease of first version...

1. Fighters -> Move orders only, auto attacks when enemy is in range.
2. Home Station, tap to toggle between fighter and probe building.
3. Probes can be given a direction and speed to launch in and have limited fuel.
