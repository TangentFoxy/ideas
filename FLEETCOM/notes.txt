cost - increases based on part's costs
mass - increases based on part's masses
speed - based on mass and engine parts
range - based on engines and fuel tanks
power - based on reactors

other categories/features are added if appropriate parts are added

weapons:
- lasers are instant lines, but damage degrades with distance squared
- projectiles have a speed and must actually impact, and can impact allies

cockpit / bridge starts every ship
crew modules ? hibernation modules? colonization modules?
fuel tanks, reactors, warp drives, teleport systems, armor, shielding...

I want to focus on larger ships and not too much detail.

Icons are based on mass of ships.

Also, each type of module has a probability modifier to say how likely it is
to be hit by enemy fire (essentially, is it an internal component or not).

Parts can be damaged or destroyed. Damaged parts can be partially functional,
and can be repaired when out of combat. Destroyed parts can only be repaired
at dry dock.
