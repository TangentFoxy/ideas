- Credits to buy things with.
- Structure is places to build things on planets or health for a ship.
- Supplies is materials being carried by a ship or materials on a planet available for construction.
- Workforce (aka population on planets)
- Energy for ships to go.
- Peace ("happiness") for planets improves capability.

Probably need to redo all those ideas.

Start with a planet with a few basic things to get running.

# Explore

You start with a home Planet. You must build Scout type vessels to scan for new territories.

Building vessels cost Supplies and time depending on Workforce and Peace.

- There is a time until the next Planet discovery is made which goes up exponentially.
  - Scout ships reduce this time exponentially(?).
  - Scouts can also be stationed at a Planet to give real-time data on it. They may be attacked when stationed (and will be destroyed).
  - \# of Scouts also improves detection of enemy movements (basically, movements are how many ships there are, since there is no "space", no map).

# Expand

You can capture Planets using Colony type ships. These are slow.

You can also build improvements on Planets. These cost a raw amount of Supplies and take time depending on the Workforce and Peace.

# Exploit

Planets will have different resources(?)

Research (using Currency) to get better at building things?

# Exterminate

You will run into other civilizations. You can try to coexist, or just get rid of them.
