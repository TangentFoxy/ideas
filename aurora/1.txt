colonies: size, work (size * conditions), orders
  orders:
    table of orders with percentage of work to use
    (logic: do as many items at full percentage as possible, if there is
     remaining percentage, devote it to the next item, if there are no more
     items, devote evenly among in-progress items, if there are none, devote to
     default order)
    grow (size increases), mine, build (specific designs)
